    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Allan grew up in Weston, Massachusetts. &#xA0;He received his B.S. degree in Psychology from Tufts University in 2010 and his D.M.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015. &#xA0;He comes from a large dental family - his grandfather worked in the Dental Department of Chengdu Hospital, his mother is a practicing general dentist, his cousin is currently a 3rd year dental student, and his brother is in the process of applying to dental schools. &#xA0;From assisting at his mother&#x2019;s dental practice, Allan fell in love with the field from an early age. &#xA0;He feels privileged to have been selected to UCSF&#x2019;s Postgraduate Orthodontics Residency Class of 2018. &#xA0;In his free time, Allan enjoys playing sports, reading, hiking and traveling. &#xA0;Finally, he is an avid New England Patriots fan!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
