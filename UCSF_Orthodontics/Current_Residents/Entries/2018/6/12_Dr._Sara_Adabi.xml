    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Sara Adabi is a first year orthodontic resident at UCSF. She earned her Bachelors of Science degree in Chemistry from UC Irvine and her Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from UCSF. After graduating from UCSF dental school in 2014, she spent a year doing an orthodontic research fellowship at University of Connecticut Health Center, where she published two papers in peer-reviewed journals and her love for orthodontics was solidified. Sara was born and raised in Iran but has made California her home, and couldn&#x2019;t be happier to be back! In her free time she enjoys spending time with family and friends, trying new restaurants in the city, and traveling. She was involved in craniofacial research throughout dental school and is excited to continue studying with her mentor Dr. Sneha Oberoi. She hopes to treat craniofacial patients throughout her career and believes orthodontic treatment has the ability to transform people&#x2019;s smiles and subsequently their lives.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
