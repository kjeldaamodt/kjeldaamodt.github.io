    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Dr. Hagge is the father of 2 amazing children and a husband of 8 years to his beautiful wife Nicole.&#xA0; He grew up on his family's ranch in north eastern California and worked hard in school and in his jobs so that he could go to college and pay his way to serve as a missionary for the LDS Church in the Czech Republic (central Europe) from 2003-2005. Following that amazing experience, he continued his college education at Brigham Young University - Idaho where he met his wife, Nicole, in one of his classes. After finishing their undergraduate studies together, the newlywed couple moved back to California where Dr. Hagge earned his dental degree from UCLA and is now currently a postgraduate orthodontic resident at UCSF.&#xA0; Dr. Hagge enjoys spending time with his family, playing any and all sports, fly fishing, hunting, and playing the guitar.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
