    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Stephanie Purnomo is an outdoor enthusiast. She enjoys camping and recently hiked her way up Yosemite&#x2019;s half dome. She is also a self-proclaimed expert garage sale hunter and collects succulents for fun. A bay area native, she attended UCSF for dental school and now residency. Her favorite part of ortho is talking to her patients and watching them smile bigger and brighter at each visit. &#xD;&#x201C;Orthodontics is fun and complex- it&#x2019;s a lot like solving a puzzle that is constantly in motion,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Our job is to make teeth fit together properly, but the spectacular side effect is that we create beautiful smiles too!  &#x201C;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
