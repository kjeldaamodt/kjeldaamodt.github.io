      <description>My name is D'Ann one of the first people that will greet you when you walk into the orthodontic clinic.  It is my pleasure and a privilege to work at such a world renowned institution such as UCSF.&lt;br/&gt;I come to UCSF with 18 years of dental experience, as a registered dental assistant and dental assisting instructor.  &lt;br/&gt;As the front desk treatment coordinator, I will provide you and your family with a hassle free orthodontic experience.&lt;br/&gt;In my spare time I enjoy the outdoors, cooking new recipes, reading and watching girls’ basketball. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My favorite quote: Smiles are Contagious</description>

      <description>My name is Erick Lainez and I am the Front Desk Billing Supervisor for the Orthodontic Division here at UCSF. I am a San Francisco native and currently reside in the North Bay. I have worked in the dental field for the past 7 years in both general and specialty practices. The most rewarding part of working in an Orthodontic practice is not only the staff and doctors you work with, but also the patients who one day walk in with a concern they want to address and end up with that million dollar smile they always wanted. On my spare time I enjoy reading, writing, walking my dog, trying new food, and spending time with family and friends.  </description>
