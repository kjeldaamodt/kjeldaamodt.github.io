    <description>The UCSF Orthodontics Faculty Clinic includes board-certified or board-eligible orthodontists with years of practice experience. All providers are UCSF faculty members. They are at the forefront of the orthodontics profession, publishing research and teaching the next generation of dentists and orthodontic specialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If time is an important factor for you, regular visits in faculty clinic are more efficient than in the residency program. The faculty clinic is most like a private orthodontic practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The list below includes Orthodontic Faculty Clinic Providers and other distinguished faculty in our division at UCSF.</description>

Dr. Frank first attended the University of California, Berkeley where he earned a B.A. in Neurobiology. He subsequently went to Georgetown University, School of Dentistry, where he received a DDS. He then completed an orthodontic residency at Loma Linda University, Department of Orthodontics and earned a M.S. in Orthodontics. He is also a Diplomate of the American Board of Orthodontics. Dr. Frank came to UCSF after over 30 years of private practice and then transitioned into academic teaching, by initially joining the orthodontic faculty as part time instructor and then being appointed as the full time Orthodontic Postgraduate Program Director. Dr. Frank is passionate about teaching all aspects of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics, but likes to focus on early treatment, quality finishing of orthodontic cases, and advanced diagnosis and treatment planning.</description>

For over 20 years, he held a post of Clinical Editor for the American Journal of Orthodontics, and Editor in Chief of the Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists Bulletin.  Collaboration with Korean Orthodontic University Programs has resulted in many publications on the use of temporary anchorage devices.  He has been listed as one of the top 100 authors for the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dental Orthopedics, and has reviewed over 100 articles for that publication. He has lectured on the use of 3D radiography for orthodontic treatment planning. He was honored with the opportunities to deliver the Alton Moore Lecture at the University of Washington in 2014, and the Mershon Lecture at the AAO Annual Session in San Francisco in 2015. Jerry and his wife, Pamela Grove, have six grown children and seven grandchildren.</description>

This work started as a thesis while a trainee of the Brain Research Institute at UCLA in 1970, led to several papers, a review in Physiological Reviews in 1982, a book on the Neurophysiological Principles Underlying Swallowing and Dysphagia in 1999, and the cooperation with several investigators at Johns Hopkins and the Medical College of Wisconsin in the development of a new society, the Dysphagia Research Society.  I have been on the executive board for several years and was President in 2007-2008 organizing our annual meeting which took place in Vancouver.   This annual meeting provides the basis for international investigators around the world to come and present their research.  Part of our function has been to expand our ties with investigators in Europe and Japan to develop more research presentations and joint meetings.  This has involved working with several groups in Europe and Japan to bring our different research groups closer together and has involved more traveling to German and Japan.   Many of the new concepts on rehabilitation in dysphagia are using principles established in neuroscience including electrical stimulation and transmagnetic cortical stimulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My interest in the brain stem and the neuromuscular system led to my research expanding to the craniomandibular region and its muscles, which brought me to UCSF over 40 years ago in 1975.  This interest in the craniofacial region has focused on the jaw muscles and their interaction with bone.  This has led to 15 years of research using the rhesus monkey as well as interacting with clinicians and researchers in craniofacial anomalies, temporomandibular disorders, and other dental fields. This work included publishing a book entitled:  Craniomandibular Muscles:  Their Role in Function and Form.  CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 1991.  Some of this reserach has been with a good friend and colleague, Dr. Kuotaro Maki, from Showa University in Tokyo, in which we have worked for over 20 years together. This has been a long-term interaction which culminated in expanding our original studies using CT to evaluate cortical bone mineralization, to bringing a new system to USCF using volumetric three-dimensional analysis with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).   We were the first institution in the United States to use a CBCT system, and we have developed a variety of joint projects that incorporate our orthodontic residents.   The cone beam CT system at UCSF has now become the standard for our Division of Orthodontics.   I also serve as the Director of the Oral and Craniofacial Sciences Master’s Degree program complementing my work in the Division of Orthodontics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the recent publications include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chiang C, Jeffres M, Miller AJ, Hatcher, DC.

Thus, she is ecstatic to be able to give back her time to the Division of Orthodontics as Volunteer Assistant Clinical Professor, teaching the residents orthodontic literature review as well as preparing them for the ABO written exam. Outside of teaching and practicing orthodontics, Nga enjoys salsa-dancing, reading, and being one with the great outdoors.</description>
