    <description>Volunteer and Attending Professors oversee teaching activities of the residents in the UCSF Orthodontic clinic.

In the resident practice, treatment is managed by a UCSF faculty member in concert with a postgraduate resident. Residents are licensed dentists who are in a three-year training program to become orthodontic specialists. &#x2028;
Your treatment plan is developed by your resident, together with an attending faculty member. At each visit you are seen by both the resident and faculty member. Visits can take longer, but fees in the residency program are lower than in the faculty clinic or at other private practices. </description>
